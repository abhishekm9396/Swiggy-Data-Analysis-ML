--Results--

Through data visualization, the project presents the findings in a visually engaging manner, using charts, graphs, and maps. These visual representations help to understand the patterns, trends, and disparities related to Covid-19, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop appropriate response measures.


--Challenges Faced--

1. Collecting data from single platform for different restaurants was time consuming. Getting data well and consistent across different  sources requires careful data cleaning and processing.
2. Needed extensive research and data analysis to ensure that the model's recommendations are accurate and relevant to the target audience.
