--Challenges--

1. As all of our team members are working professionals, we were finding difficulty in managing time 
and the time availability of each team member is different.
Firstly, we brainstormed and formed a flowchart of works that helped us be on track.
We allocated the work according to each personâ€™s time availability and task priority.
2. One of the main challenges faced in this project is collecting data from JSON using Python API.


Overall, The "Covid-19-Data-Analysis" project serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and the general public interested in gaining insights into the global or regional dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic. It aims to contribute to the collective knowledge surrounding the virus, aid in informed decision-making, and support efforts to combat and mitigate its effects on public health and society as a whole.
